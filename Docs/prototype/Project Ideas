These Are Our Project Ideas:

1. Transfer playlists between music services such as Spotify and Apple Music.

  Utilize a Database:
    - Profile/User Info 
    - Login Info for EACH SERVICE

  2 Publicly Available Datasets:
    - Spotify Playlists
    - Apple Music Playlists 

  Third Party Authentication:
    - Use for BOTH Streaming Services (I believe Spotify for Developers uses OAuth) !!

2, Pull a user’s playlist from Spotify and correlate it with a feed that has concert dates to alert the user of bands that they like that are playing nearby

  Utilize a Database: 
    - Profile/User Info 
    - Login Info for Spotify 
    - Access to Location Services

  2 Public Datasets: 
    - Spotify Playlists
    - Venues & Performances in Current City 

  Third Party Authentication 
    - Use for Spotify Login to Confirm User
    - Use Text Code OR Email (Or Give Choice) — Whatever is connected to Spotify Login 
    
3. A cooking app that allows users to upload and find recipes, connected to a delivery service that can deliver necessary ingredients

  Database:
    - Profile/User Info
    - Submitted Recipes
    - Grocery Options
    - Access to Location
    
  APIs:
    - Instacart API
    - Spoonacular API
